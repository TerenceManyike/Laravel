On this project I built a Users, Product and Content Management Admin website where admin users can:
    Manage the permissions role for each user.
    Perform crud operations to manage product's categories and tags.
    Perform crud operations to manage content pages.
    
Product retrieval from an API and JS DOM manipulation to select product color and size.
On backend, sanctum authentication was used to build the API.
